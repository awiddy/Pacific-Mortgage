			<p>
				I have been a in the mortgage industry for almost two decades and a licensed
				Mortgage Broker since 2005. I was born and raised in Switzerland and after
				obtaining a degree in business, I came to the US not planning to stay for a long
				time. However, after graduating Summa Cum Laude from the University of
				California at Berkeley I decided to make my home here. I have lived in Southern
				California ever since, together with my wife and three children.
				<br />
				I founded Pacific Mortgage Co with the goal in mind to provide both excellence
				in lending to my clients, but also to provide a solid infrastructure and support
				for other loan officers that allows them to excel as well.
				<br />
				Every loan transaction is as unique as is the financial and credit profile of each
				individual client. Matching a client’s specific situation and goals with the right
				loan program is my mission and excellence in execution is my daily goal. We
				have expanded our lending partner network to over 30 lenders and offer
				hundreds of loan programs. This allows us to offer every client the broadest
				selection of solutions to their individual situation.
				<br />
				Although, giving our geographic location, we tend to work with many affluent
				clients, I put the same effort into working with a first time home buyer as I do
				working with a seasoned real estate investor.
				<br />
				Rather unique for the mortgage industry, I am an experts in both residential and
				commercial real estate lending. You can rely on our expertise for an apartment
				purchase as much as you trust us with a VA, FHA, or Reverse mortgage
				transaction.
				<br />
				Contact me today. I look forward to hearing from you.
