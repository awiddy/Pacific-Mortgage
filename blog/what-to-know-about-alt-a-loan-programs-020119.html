				R5 Instances</br>
				The memory-optimized R5 instances use custom Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8000 Series (Skylake-SP) processors running at up to 3.1 GHz, powered by sustained all-core Turbo Boost. They are perfect for distributed in-memory caches, in-memory analytics, and big data analytics, and are available in six sizes:

            For most people, buying a home is the largest investment they will ever make. Applying for a mortgage is the most time-consuming – and sometimes most difficult – part of the home buying process. Credit score, employment history, debt, and loan-to-value ratio can all affect what kinds of rates and loans are offered.
            </p>
            <h4> Types of mortgages</h4>
            <p>
            The three most common types of mortgages are prime, subprime, and Alt-A mortgages. Prime mortgages are offered to borrowers with good credit scores and minor debt; they are considered low risk and typically receive the lowest interest rates. Subprime mortgages are for borrowers with low credit scores who are considered high risk; the higher interest rates help banks compensate for the added risk when issuing these loans. Alt-A loans are somewhere in between prime and subprime both in terms of risks and interest rates. 
            </p>
            <h4> Basics of Alt-A loans </h4>
            <p>
            Alt-A loans are known for being low-to-no documentation loans. Instead of providing extensive documentation, borrowers simply need to state their income, assets, and expenses. This can benefit those without consistent monthly income such as small business owners.
            </p>
            <p>
            Another feature of Alt-A loans is that they have low down payment requirements and a corresponding higher loan-to-value ratio. While most prime mortgages have LTV ratios of 80%, the LTV of an Alt-A loan can be as high as 100%.
            </p>
            <p>
            The debt-to-income ratio for Alt-A loans is usually higher than the standard. While most loans require a DTI of 36%, Alt-A loans can exceed 43%. 
            </p>
            <h4> Who benefits from Alt-A loans?</h4>
            <p>
            Alt-A loans are good options for borrowers with good financial and credit history but lower income. Entrepreneurs, freelancers, and other seasonal workers may benefit from Alt-A loan terms due to their inability to document a consistent income; this type of loan can also benefit small business owners whose net income may be lowered by extensive tax deductions. 
            </p>
          <h4> The bottom line</h4>
          <p>
          Alt-A loans are an excellent mortgage choice for those with good credit, but without a steady, documentable income. While they can be high-risk loans for lenders, Alt-A mortgages can help small business owners, entrepreneurs, and other self-employed workers buy their dream homes. 
          </p>
