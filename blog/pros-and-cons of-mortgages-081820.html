				R5 Instances</br>
				The memory-optimized R5 instances use custom Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8000 Series (Skylake-SP) processors running at up to 3.1 GHz, powered by sustained all-core Turbo Boost. They are perfect for distributed in-memory caches, in-memory analytics, and big data analytics, and are available in six sizes:

<p>One of the most important choices borrowers make is the length of their loan. A traditional 30-year mortgage may have lower payments each month - but homeowners pay significantly more interest over the life of the loan. Likewise, with a 15-year mortgage, homeowners pay less in interest but have a higher monthly payment.</p>
<p>The decision to choose a 15- or 30-year mortgage is unique for every borrower. Potential buyers should evaluate their current finances, their financial goals, and factors such as how long they want to stay in their new home before deciding which loan is right for them.</p>
<h4>30-year mortgages</h4>
<p>30-year mortgages are the standard loan choice for most homebuyers. With a fixed mortgage rate and low monthly payments, homeowners can save money each month – especially when compared to renting. However, because payments are stretched over such a long period of time, buyers pay significant amounts of interest if they hold onto the rate until its final pay-off date. For example, if buyers take out a $200,000 loan as a 30-year mortgage with an interest rate of 4.3%, they will have a monthly payment of around $980; however, they will also pay over $150,000 in interest alone over the life of the loan.</p>
<h4>Pros of a 30-year mortgage</h4>
<ul>
<li>Lower monthly payment</li>
<li>More cash for other projects or financial goals, such as home improvements, investing, college savings, or</li>
<li>retirement funds</li>
<li>Qualify for a higher loan amount</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of a 30-year mortgage</h4>
<ul>
<li>Potentially higher mortgage rate</li>
<li>Pay more interest over the life of the loan</li>
<li>Home equity builds slowly as less money is paid towards the principal</li>
</ul>
<h4>15-year mortgages</h4>
<p>Borrowers applying for 15-year mortgages can often get lower interest rates – and pay less in interest over the life of the loan. A $200,000 15-year mortgage at an interest rate of 3.6% would have a monthly payment of around $1,440; the borrowers would only pay around $52,000 in interest over the life of the loan.</p>
<h4>Pros of a 15-year mortgage</h4>
<ul>
<li>Pay off the mortgage faster</li>
<li>Qualify for lower interest rates</li>
<li>Pay less interest over the life of the loan</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of a 15-year mortgage</h4>
<ul>
<li>Higher monthly payment</li>
<li>Less cash each month for other expenses</li>
<li>Qualify for a lower loan amount</li>
</ul>
<h4>Which loan is right for me?</h4>
<p>For borrowers with monthly cash flow as a main concern, a 30-year mortgage may be the best choice. These borrowers pay a lower amount each month, leaving more money free for other financial goals. Likewise, homeowners can choose to pay more each month or in a lump sum each year towards the principal, shortening the terms of the loan.</p>
<p>30-year mortgages are also a better choice for buyers who plan to stay in a home for 8 years or less. Those buying their “forever home” where they want to spend 20 years – or longer – living may be better suited to a 15-year mortgage as it saves them tens of thousands of dollars in interest over the years. Those choosing 15-year mortgages can also get interest rates as much as 1% lower than those for a 30-year loan.</p>
