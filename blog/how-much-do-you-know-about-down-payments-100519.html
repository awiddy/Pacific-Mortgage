				Just last week I told you about our plans to launch EC2 Instances with Faster Processors and More Memory. Today I am happy to report that the R5, R5d, and z1d instances are available now and you can start using them today. Let’s take a look at each one!

				R5 Instances</br>
				The memory-optimized R5 instances use custom Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8000 Series (Skylake-SP) processors running at up to 3.1 GHz, powered by sustained all-core Turbo Boost. They are perfect for distributed in-memory caches, in-memory analytics, and big data analytics, and are available in six sizes:

 Most homebuyers still mistakenly believe that every home purchase with a loan requires a 20% down payment. However, modern financing options are more diverse than ever before – and many require little to no down payment. The following guide can help potential buyers better understand down payments, how they work, and how to choose the right amount.
</p>

<h4>What is a down payment?</h4>
<p>
A down payment is the money that buyers pay at the origination of a loan – whether that is for a home, vehicle, or other large asset. Money for a down payment often comes from personal savings, while smaller loans may allow you to put the down payment amount on a credit card. 
</p>
<p>
Down payments are sometimes – but not always – a part of a loan. The amount that is made in a down payment will affect the amount the loan is for, as well as what the monthly payments will be. A larger down payment equates to a smaller loan, which in turn leads to a lower monthly payment; a smaller down payment, however, can leave money in the bank to pay for immediate projects and improvements. 
</p>

<h4>How much should I put down?</h4>
<p>
Some believe that a bigger down payment is always better; others prefer to make the down payment as small as possible. There are pros and cons to both methods, and buyers should evaluate their savings, future earnings, or plans for a home before making a decision on down payment amount.
</p>
<h4>Benefits of going small</h4>

<p>Benefits of a small down payment include:</p>
<p>
-	Buy sooner. Saving 20 percent can take years – particularly in expensive markets. A small down payment can help buyers purchase a new home sooner. 
-	Leave money in the bank. Many buyers eliminate the majority of their savings to make a down payment. A small down payment leaves plenty of money for emergency reserve funds. 
-	Money for improvements. Instead of making a large down payment, money can instead be used to make immediate improvements or changes to a property.
-	Other opportunities. Money can be used for investments, retirements, or business opportunities instead of being tied up in a house. 
</p>
<h4>Go big or go home</h4>

<p>Benefits of a big down payment include:</p>
<p>
-	Lower rates. When buyers are prepared to put a large amount down, lenders may be willing to lower their interest rates. 
-	No PMI. With a down payment of more than 20%, buyers are able to avoid mortgage insurance and other upfront payments. 
-	Lower monthly payment. The bigger a down payment, the smaller the size of the loan – and the smaller the monthly payments. 
-	Future borrowing power. A large down payment can improve a buyers debt-to-income ratio, making it easier to qualify for additional loans in the future. 
-	Potential equity. A large down payment is in investment in the home; when buyers put down a large sum, they are immediately increasing the equity value of a home. 
</p>
<h4>Lender Requirements </h4>
<p>
Down payment requirements vary from lender to lender – and from loan to loan. While conventional and FHA loans can have down payments as low as 3%, PMI is required. VA loans, however, are available to qualifying military members with no down payment. Check with individual lenders for more information about down payment requirements.
