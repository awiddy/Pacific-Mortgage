				Just last week I told you about our plans to launch EC2 Instances with Faster Processors and More Memory. Today I am happy to report that the R5, R5d, and z1d instances are available now and you can start using them today. Let’s take a look at each one!

				R5 Instances</br>
				The memory-optimized R5 instances use custom Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8000 Series (Skylake-SP) processors running at up to 3.1 GHz, powered by sustained all-core Turbo Boost. They are perfect for distributed in-memory caches, in-memory analytics, and big data analytics, and are available in six sizes:

                        A mortgage pre-approval is what separates home browsers from home buyers. It signals that you’re serious about buying a home and ready to take the next steps in the process. 
                        </p>
                       
                        <p>
                        If you watch house hunting shows on TV, it seems simple to walk into a bank or mortgage broker and receive a pre-approval letter. Like a lot of things, though, the process in real life is a little more complicated than how it looks on TV.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Here’s what you need to know about the mortgage pre-approval process:
                        </p>
                        <h4> Choosing a lender or lenders</h4>
                        <p>
                        The first step in the pre-approval process is to select a lender to issue the pre-approval letter. Shop around for lenders offering the best rates, or work with a mortgage broker to choose one. 
                        </p>
                         <p>
                        Just like getting a second opinion from a doctor, having more than one pre-approval is sometimes beneficial. You might find that one lender qualifies you for a higher amount than another, or that one is easier to work with.
                        </p>
                         <p>
                        Again, a mortgage broker can help with this part of the process by selecting the lender for you and working as an intermediary in the pre-approval process.
                        </p>
                        <h4> Submitting the application</h4>
                        <p>
                        The goal of the pre-approval is to provide an accurate estimate of your financial picture and how much you can realistically spend on a home. To do that, lenders need to know how much you make, what your expenses are, and how much debt you already have. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Be prepared to provide the following as part of the pre-approval process:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                        <li> Pay stubs</li>
                        <li> W-2</li>
                        <li> Bank account statements</li>
                        <li> Federal tax returns from the past two years</li>
                        <li> Statements from 401K, IRA, and other investment accounts if applicable</li>
                        <li> A gift letter, if you’re using funds from a relative to help cover the down payment</li>
                        
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                        The lender will also run your credit report. We recommend pulling a report for yourself a few months before pre-approval so you can correct any errors you find or figure out how to boost your credit score if needed.
                        </p>
                        <h4>	Obtaining the letter </h4>
                        <p>
                        Once the pre-approval screening is complete, you’ll receive a letter stating how much that lender would be willing to give you to buy a home. Think of it as the maximum you should spend on a home and try to stay under the listed amount if possible.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Most mortgage pre-approvals expire within 60 or 90 days, so you might need to go through the process again if you do not apply for a mortgage within that time frame.
                        </p>
