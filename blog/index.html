                <h2><strong>Factors that can affect your credit score</strong>
                    <h2>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../images/Factorsthatcanaffectyourcreditscore.jpg" alt="Factors that can affect your credit score"
                                style="max-width: 100%;">
                            <!--style added to make image responsive-->
                        </figure>
                        <p>From buying a home to applying for student loans, your credit score can impact whether you
                            can move forward on your financial journey. If you are trying to repair a bad score or
                            maintain a good one, it’s important to know what factors go into compiling the score.
                        </p>

                        <p>More than 27 million credit scores are calculated each day, based primarily on the following
                            factors:</p>
                        <strong style="font-size:22px">Payment history</strong>
                        <p>
                            This is by far the most important factor in calculating a credit score and accounts for
                            about 35 percent of the overall score. The best indicator of how you’ll handle a new loan
                            or credit card is your behavior with past accounts.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Missed payments and late payments can drive your score down quickly. The best way to
                            improve or maintain a good score is to make consistent, on-time payments on all existing
                            loans and credit cards.
                        </p>

                        <strong style="font-size:22px">Credit utilization</strong>
                        <p>
                            After payment history, credit utilization, or how much of your available credit you are
                            using, is the next most important factor in determining a credit score. It accounts for
                            about 30 percent of your credit score. In short, just because you have a high credit limit
                            does not mean you should max out a credit card — even if you pay the bill in full each
                            month.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Credit bureaus like to see an overall utilization rate of less than 10 percent, and no more
                            than 30 percent. Of course, things happen that might constitute a higher utilization from
                            time to time, but this should be the exception and not the rule.
                        </p>
                        <strong style="font-size:22px">Credit history</strong>
                        <p>
                            Credit history includes the age of your oldest and newest credit accounts, the average age
                            of your accounts, and whether you’ve used the accounts recently. You can’t change time, but
                            you can control this credit score factor by applying for and opening new credit accounts
                            only as you need them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It might seem tempting to open a new credit card to take advantage of a promotion or
                            discount, but is the benefit really worth the ding to your credit score? Credit history
                            accounts for about 15 percent of your overall credit score.
                        </p>

                        <strong style="font-size:22px">Credit inquiries and credit mix</strong>
                        <p>
                            Somewhat vaguer than the other factors, this one accounts for about 10 percent of your
                            credit score. Credit reporting bureaus are looking for evidence that you can be responsible
                            with all types of credit, including loans, mortgages, and credit cards.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Your credit score can also go down every time a bank or credit card company checks your
                            credit before issuing a new account. This is unavoidable if you want to open a new account,
                            but try to keep the inquiries to a minimum, especially on credit cards.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Whether you want to lower your mortgage payment or access some cash for home renovations,
                            refinancing your home is a great way to access your home’s equity.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Self-employed borrower naturally have the goal of reporting as little net income as
                            possible which can conflict with a 2nd goal: qualifying for a real estate purchase or
                            refinance! We can help you to make the right decision to achieve both by working with
                            borrowers and CPAs to achieve both goals. It’s not only the bottom line number that matter,
                            it’s the details inside the tax return that can decide the achievement of your financial
                            goals.
                            There are a few steps you need to take to make sure that you’re ready to refinance. The
                            more prepared you are up front, the smoother the process will go. Here are a few helpful
                            tips:
                        </p>
                        <strong style="font-size:22px">Review Your Credit Report</strong>
                        <p>
                            Any home refinance is going to involve a lender running your credit report. Before any bank
                            looks at the report, you should check it to make sure there are no surprises. You can
                            obtain a free copy of your credit report once a year from each of the three major credit
                            bureaus (Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Once you have the reports, work on correcting any errors you see and make sure that the
                            report presents a stable financial picture. Lenders like to see a low debt-to-income ratio
                            and plenty of available credit. You may decide that you need to hold off on refinancing for
                            a few months while you pay down or consolidate other debt.
                        </p>
                        <strong style="font-size:22px">Estimate Your Home’s Value</strong>

                        <p>
                            Your home will be formally assessed as part of the refinancing process, but doing your own
                            research ahead of time will help you know where things stand and how much you stand to save
                            by refinancing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sites like Zillow are great resources for checking out home values and recent sales in your
                            area. Mortgage lenders typically like to see that you owe less than 80 percent of your
                            home’s value. If your research shows that you owe more than that, you might want to focus
                            on paying down your mortgage balance or waiting until home values increase before
                            refinancing.
                        </p>
                        <strong style="font-size:22px">Collect Financial Documents</strong>
                        <p>
                            Once your credit report is in order and you’ve determined what your home is worth, the last
                            step in preparing for a refinance is gathering all of the paperwork necessary to make it
                            happen. If you bought your home a while ago, you might have forgotten about all of the
                            documents needed to complete the sale.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You’ll need pay stubs for proof of income, bank and investment statements, and tax returns
                            from the past two years. If you receive income child support, alimony, or other sources, be
                            prepared to provide those documents as well.
                        </p>
