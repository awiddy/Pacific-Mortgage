			   Buying a home is the biggest purchase most people will make in their lifetimes. Unfortunately, many first time buyers often begin scheduling showings or visiting open houses before they are ready to buy.  There are a number of ways agents can guide buyers – even if they aren’t ready to buy today. 
		 </p>
		 <h4> Common reasons clients aren’t ready to buy</h4>
		 <ol>
			 <li>
				 <h4>Finances aren’t in order </h4>
				 <p>
					 Not being financially ready is the primary reason buyers aren’t able to immediately purchase a home. Whether it is not having a preapproval letter from a lender, not having enough for the down payment, or being unable to cover closing costs, make sure to frankly discuss the financial aspects of homeownership as early as possible. Help first time buyers get their finances in order by encouraging them to check their credit scores, build their credit in other ways, and save aggressively towards a down payment. 
				 </p>
			 </li>
			 
		 </ol>

                    </h2></a>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../images/Factorsthatcanaffectyourcreditscore.jpg" alt="Factors that can affect your credit score"

                        </figure>
                        <p>From buying a home to applying for student loans, your credit score can impact whether you
                            can move forward on your financial journey. If you are trying to repair a bad score or
                            maintain a good one, it’s important to know what factors go into compiling the score.
                        </p>

                        <p>More than 27 million credit scores are calculated each day, based primarily on the following
                            factors:</p>
                        <strong style="font-size:22px">Payment history</strong>
                        <p>
                            This is by far the most important factor in calculating a credit score and accounts for
                            about 35 percent of the overall score. The best indicator of how you’ll handle a new loan
                            or credit card is your behavior with past accounts.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Missed payments and late payments can drive your score down quickly. The best way to
                            improve or maintain a good score is to make consistent, on-time payments on all existing
                            loans and credit cards.
                        </p>

                        <strong style="font-size:22px">Credit utilization</strong>
                        <p>
                            After payment history, credit utilization, or how much of your available credit you are
                            using, is the next most important factor in determining a credit score. It accounts for
                            about 30 percent of your credit score. In short, just because you have a high credit limit
                            does not mean you should max out a credit card — even if you pay the bill in full each
                            month.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Credit bureaus like to see an overall utilization rate of less than 10 percent, and no more
                            than 30 percent. Of course, things happen that might constitute a higher utilization from
                            time to time, but this should be the exception and not the rule.
                        </p>
                        <strong style="font-size:22px">Credit history</strong>
                        <p>
                            Credit history includes the age of your oldest and newest credit accounts, the average age
                            of your accounts, and whether you’ve used the accounts recently. You can’t change time, but
                            you can control this credit score factor by applying for and opening new credit accounts
                            only as you need them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It might seem tempting to open a new credit card to take advantage of a promotion or
                            discount, but is the benefit really worth the ding to your credit score? Credit history
                            accounts for about 15 percent of your overall credit score.
                        </p>

                        <strong style="font-size:22px">Credit inquiries and credit mix</strong>
                        <p>
                            Somewhat vaguer than the other factors, this one accounts for about 10 percent of your
                            credit score. Credit reporting bureaus are looking for evidence that you can be responsible
                            with all types of credit, including loans, mortgages, and credit cards.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Your credit score can also go down every time a bank or credit card company checks your
                            credit before issuing a new account. This is unavoidable if you want to open a new account,
                            but try to keep the inquiries to a minimum, especially on credit cards.

                        </p>

                            Whether you want to lower your mortgage payment or access some cash for home renovations,
                            refinancing your home is a great way to access your home’s equity.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Self-employed borrower naturally have the goal of reporting as little net income as
                            possible which can conflict with a 2nd goal: qualifying for a real estate purchase or
                            refinance! We can help you to make the right decision to achieve both by working with
                            borrowers and CPAs to achieve both goals. It’s not only the bottom line number that matter,
                            it’s the details inside the tax return that can decide the achievement of your financial
                            goals.
                            There are a few steps you need to take to make sure that you’re ready to refinance. The
                            more prepared you are up front, the smoother the process will go. Here are a few helpful
                            tips:
                        </p>
                        <strong style="font-size:22px">Review Your Credit Report</strong>
                        <p>
                            Any home refinance is going to involve a lender running your credit report. Before any bank
                            looks at the report, you should check it to make sure there are no surprises. You can
                            obtain a free copy of your credit report once a year from each of the three major credit
                            bureaus (Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Once you have the reports, work on correcting any errors you see and make sure that the
                            report presents a stable financial picture. Lenders like to see a low debt-to-income ratio
                            and plenty of available credit. You may decide that you need to hold off on refinancing for
                            a few months while you pay down or consolidate other debt.
                        </p>
                        <strong style="font-size:22px">Estimate Your Home’s Value</strong>

                        <p>
                            Your home will be formally assessed as part of the refinancing process, but doing your own
                            research ahead of time will help you know where things stand and how much you stand to save
                            by refinancing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sites like Zillow are great resources for checking out home values and recent sales in your
                            area. Mortgage lenders typically like to see that you owe less than 80 percent of your
                            home’s value. If your research shows that you owe more than that, you might want to focus
                            on paying down your mortgage balance or waiting until home values increase before
                            refinancing.
                        </p>
                        <strong style="font-size:22px">Collect Financial Documents</strong>
                        <p>
                            Once your credit report is in order and you’ve determined what your home is worth, the last
                            step in preparing for a refinance is gathering all of the paperwork necessary to make it
                            happen. If you bought your home a while ago, you might have forgotten about all of the
                            documents needed to complete the sale.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You’ll need pay stubs for proof of income, bank and investment statements, and tax returns
                            from the past two years. If you receive income child support, alimony, or other sources, be
                            prepared to provide those documents as well.
                        </p>

			  Buying a home is the largest purchase that most of us will ever make, and it’s not one that should be taken lightly. Working with a financial planner can help make this daunting task seem doable by giving you a roadmap to work from.
		 </p>
		 <p>
			  One of the biggest ways financial planners help their clients is in the mortgage qualification process. Here are some of the ways they can do that:
		 </p>
			 <h4> Understand Debt to Income Ratio </h4>
		<p>
		 A financial planner can help you make sense of how much you can realistically afford each month based on your existing debt and other monthly expenses.  It’s helpful to have this conversation and know where things stand before you start looking at homes. Otherwise, you might fall in love with a house that you can’t realistically afford and end up on the path to default or foreclosure.
		</p>
		 <h4> Down Payment Saving Strategies </h4>
		</p>
		 <p>
		As home values continue to rise, putting 20 percent — or even 10 percent — down on a home seems like a daunting task. But, putting in a little extra cash up front can help you avoid paying private mortgage insurance as part of your loan.
		</p>
		<p>	
		A financial planner will assess your income and expenses and help you determine how much you can realistically save each month. Once you know that, you can determine how long it will take to amass a down payment and when you will be ready to begin the mortgage qualification process.
		</p>
		<h4>Credit Score TLC </h4>
		<p>
			Like applying for any loan or line of credit, qualifying for a mortgage requires a check on your credit report. A poor credit score or sketchy credit history could mean the difference between qualifying and not qualifying or between a low interest rate and a high one — so it’s in your interest to put your best financial foot forward.
		</p>
		<p>
		A financial planner will review your credit reports from all three reporting bureaus and help you address any errors or problems that you uncover. It can be an arduous process, but one that’s well worth it in the end.
		</p>

		Buying a home represents a major investment; for many potential buyers, it will be the most significant of their life. Because of this, it is important to go into the homebuying process prepared, organized, and intentional. The following steps can help potential buyers prepare to look for a house, apply for a mortgage, and successfully close on their new home.	  
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li> <h4>Financially prepare for the mortgage process</h4>
				<p>
				Without question, the most important part of the home buying process is applying for and securing a mortgage. To increase the chance to get the best rates on the market, begin financially preparing for the mortgage process up to a year in advance. Stop applying for new lines of credit at least one year before applying for a new mortgage – and keep the moratorium on new financing in place until after closing. Likewise, regularly check your credit score for inconsistencies and accuracy. While scores above 700 can ensure financing, a credit score of 750 or higher ensures the best rates. 
				“Below 660 or 680, you’re either going to have to pay sizable fees or a higher down payment,” said Barry Zigas, director of housing policy for the Consumer Federation of America.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li><h4> Determine what you can afford  </h4>
				<p>
					For most potential buyers, monthly mortgage payments and other expenses should add up to less than 30% of their gross monthly income. Exceeding this can cause buyers to become “house poor”; this occurs when the majority of monthly income is spend on mortgage payments, insurance, utilities, and other expenses, leaving little to no room for other monthly expenses or building savings. 
				</p>
				
			</li>
			<li> <h4> Save for down payment and closing </h4>
				<p>
					A down payment of between 3 and 20 percent is recommended for most buyers. Having enough money in savings to start with a large down payment can help reduce monthly mortgage costs or make a costlier home more affordable. If you are unable to put a large enough amount down on a home, the lender may require PMI, or private mortgage insurance, on the loan. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Cash will also be required for closing. Average closing costs are between 2 and 5 percent of the cost of the home; purchasing a $150,000 home can cost between $3,000 and $7,500 at closing. A recent national survey found that the average buyer pays $3,700 at closing. Responsibility for closing costs can also be negotiated as a part of the real estate contract.

		  <p>
			  Anyone who has applied for a credit card, auto loan, mortgage, or other type of financing has heard the term FICO score. Despite this, few fully understand what this credit score means or how it is determined. The following guide can help consumers better understand the country’s most widely recognized credit-scoring model. 
		</p>
			<h4> The history of FICO </h4>
		<p>
			FICO stands for Fair Isaac Corporation, a predictive analytics company that was founded in 1956. The group began creating credit risk scores in 1981; these three-digit scores represent “the likelihood that you will pay all of your (debt) obligations on time for the foreseeable future,” said Barry Paperno, former consumer affairs manager for FICO.
		</p>
			<h4> How are FICO scores created?</h4>
		<p>
			FICO credit scores can range from 300 to 850, with some industry-specific scores going to 900. The scores are based on credit reports, or the statements generated by consumer credit reporting bureaus based on your credit activity and current debt. 
		</p>
		<p>
			FICO scores are broken down into five categories. Each category has a percentage value that indicates how much it affects the overall score. 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Payment history (35%): Your history of paying bills on time, late payments, or bankruptcies </li>
			<li>Amounts owed (30%): How much debt you carry, including credit card debt and installment loans such as student loans or mortgages. </li>
			<li> Credit history length (15%): The age of your accounts and how often they are used </li>
			<li> New credit (10%): How many recent inquiries have been made of your </li>
			<li> Credit mix (10%): The different accounts you have, such as banking, credit cards, or mortgages </li>
		</ul>
			<h4> Why are FICO scores important? </h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Credit scores are used to assess how likely a person will be to repay their debt; for this reason, financial institutions heavily rely on credit scores when offering loans. Borrowers with high FICO scores can often secure better interest rates and other terms of the loan. FICO scores are also sometimes used by insurance providers, landlords, and other companies as a way to ascertain a person’s financial dependability. 
				</li>
				<li>
					“If your scores are high, then you’re likely to get approved with competitive rates and terms,” said credit expert John Ulzheimer. “If your scores are low, then you could be denied or approved with less-advantageous terms.”
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h4> Why are there different FICO scores? </h4>
			<ul>
				<li> While there are several dozen forms of FICO scores, they can generally be categorized into two groups: base FICO scores and industry-specific FICO scores. Base FICO scores are the most widely used. Industry-specific FICO scores are used for certain credit products, such as auto loans or credit cards.
				</li>
				<li> 
					“Despite widespread use of the term ‘FICO score’ as a single score, FICO is actually the brand, with dozens of scores falling underneath that brand,” Ulzheimer said. This creates multiple editions of each scoring model; while lenders can choose which scoring model to use – leading to slight variations in FICO scores – the base criteria remains the same."
				</li>

		  <p>
			Don’t let rising interest rates keep you from purchasing the home of your dreams. High rates might change the type of home you buy, but they should not be enough to make or break a decision to buy in the first place.  
		</p>
		<p>
		Here are a few things to keep in mind as you are considering whether or not to buy a home as interest rates rise:		
		</p>
			<h4> Rates are still historically low </h4>
		<p>
			If you purchased a home today, the interest rate would be around 4.6 percent, which is still well below where rates were before 2008. Markets change over time, but your interest rate will remain constant.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can always refinance to get a lower rate, but you’ll never have one higher than the one you lock in at closing. With a strong economy, rates are likely to continue rising, so waiting to buy a home will cost you even more down the road — both in interest rates and higher home values.
		</p>
		<h4> You have more room in your budget than you think <h4>
		<p>
		    As you already know, the higher the interest rate, the more you’ll pay for your home each month. But the difference might not be quite as big as you’d expect.		
		</p>
		<p>
			For example, $200,000 mortgage with a 30-year fixed rate at 4 percent interest has a monthly payment of  $954.83. At a 4.5 percent interest rate, the payment goes to $1,013.37; at 5 percent it becomes $1,073.64.
		</p>
		<p>
			A financial planner can help you identify changes to your budget to absorb the higher monthly cost while making sure that you don’t overextend yourself in the process.
		</p>
			<h4>Fear of missing out</h4>
			<p>
				That’s right, FOMO. You might have experienced it in other areas of your life, and it definitely applies to buying a home. When the home of your dreams is on the market, you need to act, regardless of where interest rates might be.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can’t do anything to change the rates, so don’t let them stop you from landing the home you want. Instead, we can help you find a mortgage lender who can help you get the best rate possible and put you on the right financial track.
			</p>

            Surprises are best saved for birthday parties – not the home buying process. A major hiccup in the loan process is the worst case scenario that keeps both buyers and sellers awake at night. To avoid problems in escrow coming between you and your dream home – or your money – do this to avoid home loan drama.
            </p>
            <h4>
            Do: Keep finances steady 
            </h4>
            <p>
            Lenders want to see consistency in your bank statements and credit reports; billed pays on time and direct deposits from paychecks on a regular schedule shows lenders you have the financial means and responsibility to cover the mortgage. Spending beyond your means, carrying too much debt, or even receiving large, unexplained deposits can affect things before closing.
            </p>
            <h4> Don’t: Open new lines of credit</h4>
            <p>
            While most people know not to buy a car while in escrow, many buyers still attempt to finance new appliances, open new credit cards, or secure other lines of credit before closing. Banks often run a second credit check before closing; avoid major purchases during escrow to keep closing on time.
            </p>
            <h4> Do: Make a full disclosure on the application</h4>
            <p>
            Underwriters are notorious sticklers; they want to ensure every i is dotted and t is crossed before approving the loan and sending the mortgage into escrow. To avoid a delay in closing, make sure you disclose judgements, liens, debts, accounts, and other information up front
            </p>
            <h4> Don’t: Assume closing costs are the same every day</h4>
            <p> 
            Closing costs can vary widely depending on when in the month closing occurs; changing the closing date may seem easy, but it can leave you saddled with additional prepaid mortgage interest. For short sales or foreclosures, make sure to save a little additional extra cash for closing costs as closing is frequently delayed. 
            </p>
            <h4>Do: Update mortgage rates</h4>
            <p>
            If you received pre-approval weeks – or months – before you found your new home, make sure to ask the lender for updated mortgage rates once you have a firm closing date. Mortgage rates can change significantly in a short time; getting updated information can help you better estimate monthly payments as well as how much you’ll need at closing. Worried about locking in the right rate? Ask your lender about mortgage rate lock.
            </p>
            <h4>Don’t: Read the contract at closing for the first time </h4>
            <p>
            One of the most tedious, yet important, parts of the closing process is reading and signing the closing documents. When your future home and moving plans in the balance, however, few homeowners take the time to closely scrutinize the documents. Avoid mistakes in the closing documents by asking to read and review them in advance. This can benefit both buyers and sellers as it ensures there are no costly or time consuming errors in the contracts.

						<p>
            Self-employment is on the rise; the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that more than 15 million Americans are currently self-employed. Whether your office is a desk in the spare bedroom, a shared work space, or even the front seat of your pickup, self-employment offers the chance to be your own boss, create your own schedule, and build a business from the ground up.
            </p>
            <p>
            For all its benefits, self-employment can also have serious downsides – particularly when it comes to buying a home. While it is true that self-employed people have to work harder to get a mortgage, it is not impossible. The following guide can help self-employed buyers prepare for the loan application process. 
            </p>
            <h4> Good documentation makes the difference</h4>
            <p>
            The beginning of the loan process is the same whether you work for a company or own your own business; expect to start by getting a rate quote, filling out an application, and providing documentation of debts and assets. 
            </p>
            <p>
            While self-employed buyers may not have a W2 to show proof of income, debt-to-income and credit requirements remain the same. Plan to show 1040 tax returns and schedules; this can be tricky as many self-employed business owners write off significantly more business expenses than regular employees, affecting net income.
            </p>
            <h4>Prepare to pay more </h4>
            <p>
            Many lenders consider self-employed applicants to be high risk; because of this, expect to pay for a slightly higher interest rate. While it may seem like a loss at first, consider it to your benefit; a solid history of on-time payments can help you refinance in the future at a lower rate. 
            </p>
            <h4> Five ways to improve the odds of being approved </h4>
            <p>
            There are several ways that self-employed applicants can improve their chances of being approved for a mortgage. 
            </p>
            <ol>
            <li> Pay yourself a W2 wage rather than taking an owner’s draw from the business. </li>
            <li> Keep separate business and personal accounts. </li>
            <li> Maintain good records. Programs like QuickBooks can help owners classify and track income and expenses as well as generate profit and loss statements.</li>
            <li> Make a larger down payment by tapping into a 401(K) or IRA account. </li>
            <li> Partner with another small business. Local banks and lenders are more likely to be flexible for other small business owners. </li>
            </ol>
            <h4> Remember that it isn’t impossible</h4>
            <p>
            While being approved for a mortgage is more difficult for self-employed business owners, it isn’t impossible! Even starting at a disadvantage, receiving a mortgage on your dream home is possible through proper documentation, willingness to pay for a higher interest rate, and dedication to building a good relationship with the lender.

					<h2></a>

            <p>
            Veterans Affairs, or VA, loans are one of the most popular perks of military service. With little-to-no down payment required and competitive interest rates, VA loans have helped more than 22 million service members become homeowners. 
            </p>
            <p>
            While these loans are an excellent option for many current and former service members, they do come with certain stipulations and requirements that set them apart from traditional loans. The following are a few things  about VA loans that both borrowers and realtors should know. 
            </p>
            <h4> 1.	VA loans can be used more than once</h4>
            <p>
            VA loans can be used over and over again – as long as the previous entitlement is paid off. Those who have a VA loan on their current home – or have lost one to foreclosure – are often still able to obtain a new loan.
            </p>
            <h4> 2.	VA loans are only for certain types of homes </h4>
            </p>
            Planning on buying a working farm, vacation condo, or fixer upper? A VA loan might not be for you. VA loans are available for primary residences in “move-in-ready” condition. Businesses, vacation properties, or houses with serious structural damage may not qualify. Benefits can be used, however, to purchase multi-unit properties such as duplexes or apartment buildings provided you will live in one of the available units. 
            </p>
            <h4>3.	VA loans aren’t issued by the VA </h4>
            </p>
            The Department of Veterans Affairs doesn’t issue the loans themselves, but the government does guarantee them. The agency typically guarantees up to a quarter of the total loan amount; this gives lenders the confidence to offer great rates and terms to service members. 
            </p>
            <h4> 4.	VA loans don’t require mortgage insurance</h4>
            <p>
            One of the most appealing aspects of VA loans is they do not require PMI, or private mortgage insurance. While most traditional mortgages require PMI if the down payment is less than 20% of the total cost of the home, VA loans have no such requirement; this means that service members can put less down on a home and save their cash for improvements, upgrades, moving expenses, or closing costs. 
            </p>
            <h4> 5.	VA loans have additional fees</h4>
            <p>
            While they do not require PMI, all VA loans incur a VA funding fee. This fee helps keep the program going by working to lower costs and is required on both purchase and refinance loans. Funding fees can be rolled into the monthly mortgage payment, and those with service-related disabilities may be able to have their fees waived. 
            </p>
            <h4> 6.	VA loans don’t have extra payment penalties</h4>
            <p>
            VA loans allow borrowers to make additional payments at any time without incurring additional fees. In addition to helping service members pay off their mortgages faster, it can help save thousands in interest fees over the life of the loan; paying as little as $100 extra a month towards the principal can make a significant difference over the life of a 30-year mortgage. 
            </p>

           <p>
           For most buyers, a new home is the single most expensive purchase they will ever make. Navigating the process can be time-consuming, frustrating, and at times confusing. While it is possible to sort through various loans and rates on your own, mortgage brokers can help you secure the best lender for your new home loan.
           </p>
           <p>
           The decision to use a mortgage broker can be polarizing; while banks and other lending institutions often advise against them, most realtors prefer to work with mortgage brokers. If you’re preparing to apply for a mortgage, here’s what you need to know about working with a mortgage broker – before you head to the big bank or credit union.
           </p>
           <h4> What do mortgage brokers do?</h4>
           <p>
           A mortgage broker is a regulated, licensed finance professional who acts as the liaison or bridge between the mortgage lender and the borrower. Because they do not work for a single lender, they can help you find the best loan with the best interest rates and terms across a variety of lending institutions. 
           </p>
           <p>
           The mortgage broker’s expertise is knowing what kinds of issues, like closing on time, will come up on loans that might make it not work at one lender, but may make it work at another.”
           </p>
           <h4> Why realtors recommend mortgage brokers</h4>
           <p>
           While most potential buyers will only go through the mortgage process a handful of times, real estate agents work with both lenders and borrowers every day. Because of this, they are uniquely positioned to understand the ins and outs of the mortgage process – including the best professionals to work with.
           </p>
           <p>
           Many realtors have close relationships with one or more mortgage broker. When they recommend a mortgage broker to potential buyers, it is not to receive kickbacks or other perks; agents recommend brokers that they trust, have worked with in the past, communicate well with, and above all else, know that they can help borrowers close on time.
           </p>
           <p>
           Brokers are mortgage experts; they can help you take the guesswork out of finding the right loan, saving you time and money by helping identify the best rates. Mortgage brokers can also make the entire process less stressful. Because they serve as the liaison between the lender and your realtor, buyers can expect fewer phone calls or emails demanding documents. 
           </p>
           <p>
           Mortgage brokers can save potential buyers’ time – as well as significantly reduce stress during the home buying process. While their services aren’t free, the right broker can make the entire loan application and escrow process easier – and help you close on your dream home on time. 
           </p>
