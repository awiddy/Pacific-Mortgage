				Just last week I told you about our plans to launch EC2 Instances with Faster Processors and More Memory. Today I am happy to report that the R5, R5d, and z1d instances are available now and you can start using them today. Let’s take a look at each one!
			</br>
				R5 Instances</br>
				The memory-optimized R5 instances use custom Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8000 Series (Skylake-SP) processors running at up to 3.1 GHz, powered by sustained all-core Turbo Boost. They are perfect for distributed in-memory caches, in-memory analytics, and big data analytics, and are available in six sizes:

						<p>
            Self-employment is on the rise; the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that more than 15 million Americans are currently self-employed. Whether your office is a desk in the spare bedroom, a shared work space, or even the front seat of your pickup, self-employment offers the chance to be your own boss, create your own schedule, and build a business from the ground up.
            </p>
            <p>
            For all its benefits, self-employment can also have serious downsides – particularly when it comes to buying a home. While it is true that self-employed people have to work harder to get a mortgage, it is not impossible. The following guide can help self-employed buyers prepare for the loan application process. 
            </p>
            <h4> Good documentation makes the difference</h4>
            <p>
            The beginning of the loan process is the same whether you work for a company or own your own business; expect to start by getting a rate quote, filling out an application, and providing documentation of debts and assets. 
            </p>
            <p>
            While self-employed buyers may not have a W2 to show proof of income, debt-to-income and credit requirements remain the same. Plan to show 1040 tax returns and schedules; this can be tricky as many self-employed business owners write off significantly more business expenses than regular employees, affecting net income.
            </p>
            <h4>Prepare to pay more </h4>
            <p>
            Many lenders consider self-employed applicants to be high risk; because of this, expect to pay for a slightly higher interest rate. While it may seem like a loss at first, consider it to your benefit; a solid history of on-time payments can help you refinance in the future at a lower rate. 
            </p>
            <h4> Five ways to improve the odds of being approved </h4>
            <p>
            There are several ways that self-employed applicants can improve their chances of being approved for a mortgage. 
            </p>
            <ol>
            <li> Pay yourself a W2 wage rather than taking an owner’s draw from the business. </li>
            <li> Keep separate business and personal accounts. </li>
            <li> Maintain good records. Programs like QuickBooks can help owners classify and track income and expenses as well as generate profit and loss statements.</li>
            <li> Make a larger down payment by tapping into a 401(K) or IRA account. </li>
            <li> Partner with another small business. Local banks and lenders are more likely to be flexible for other small business owners. </li>
            </ol>
            <h4> Remember that it isn’t impossible</h4>
            <p>
            While being approved for a mortgage is more difficult for self-employed business owners, it isn’t impossible! Even starting at a disadvantage, receiving a mortgage on your dream home is possible through proper documentation, willingness to pay for a higher interest rate, and dedication to building a good relationship with the lender.
