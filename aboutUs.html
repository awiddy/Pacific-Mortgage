						<strong>Stephan Wiederkehr, President & Mortgage Broker</strong> has been a in the mortgage industry for two
						decades and a licensed Mortgage Broker since 2005. I was born and raised in Switzerland and after
						obtaining a degree in business, I came to the US not planning to stay for a long
						time. However, after graduating Summa Cum Laude from the University of
						California at Berkeley I decided to make my home here. I have lived in Southern
						California ever since, together with my wife and three children.
						<br />
						I founded Pacific Mortgage Co with the goal of providing both excellence
						in lending to my clients, and a solid infrastructure with support
						for other loan officers that allows them to excel as well.
						<br />
						Every loan transaction is as unique as is the financial and credit profile of each
						individual client. Matching a client’s specific situation and goals with the right
						loan program is my mission and excellence in execution is my daily goal. We
						have expanded our lending partner network to over 30 lenders and offer
						hundreds of loan programs. This allows us to offer every client the broadest
						selection of solutions to their individual situation.
						<br />
						Although, given our geographic location, we tend to work with many affluent
						clients, I put the same effort into working with a first time home buyer as I do
						working with a seasoned real estate investor.
						<br />
						Uncommon in the mortgage industry, I am an expert in both residential and
						commercial real estate lending. You can rely on our expertise for an apartment
						purchase as much as you trust us with a VA, FHA, or Reverse mortgage transaction.

					<strong>Valentino Adams</strong> - I have worked in the mortgage related fields for
					many years and during that time, I have learned that my aptitude to genuinely care
					for people and their financial goals is not a very common feature in our industry.
					</br>
					Integrity is the cornerstone of how I function. I believe a mortgage
					professional should strive to build long term relationships, and helping home
					owners and buyers achieve their home financing goals. It should not be a one-off
					transaction. As a Loan Officer, I take a consultative approach to the home loan
					process by customizing each home financing solution to help customers achieve
					their home goals. Many Loan Officers can get you a loan; however, my mission is
					to find you the right loan that is best for you, not me.
					</br>
					My objective is to make all my clients feel at ease and having the ability to think outside the box has earned me
					an exceptional reputation among my clientele.
