					<dt>Stephan is the best loan broker we've ever worked with. His underwriting ability is impeccable that helped us accurately assess our "loanability", which in result saved us tons of time in searching for the right properties. When it comes to complicated transactions, his connections with lenders and experiences with various loan programs can guarantee you a loan and funding on time. We really like Stephan and his team's comprehensive service that has impressed us to a point far beyond satisfaction. We'd highly recommend him to anyone who needs a loan, whether a first time home buyer or a seasoned real estate investor.</dt>

						As a first-time homebuyer, I did the responsible thing and shopped around for a loan. Stephan Wiederkehr obtained the best rate for me, by far. He provides an exceptional level of service and is always sensitive to the many deadlines and time restraints inherent to home buying. In the eight years since I bought my home, Stephan helped me refinance and has found loans for many of my friends and family members. Whenever I hear someone is buying a house, I tell them to contact Stephan knowing he will help them obtain a more favorable loan rate.

							I want to let you know how impressed I was working with Stephan Wiederkehr on my most recent home purchase. I have never worked with a loan officer as smart and professional as Stephan. Mind you, I have purchase six properties so far.  Purchasing a home can be stressful, but he never let my thoughts and worries wander too far. He was extremely responsive, answering my questions almost instantly every time. He handled the process brilliantly.

							Finding a mortgage company to work with us was daunting, they constantly changed the numbers, never giving us the same answer twice. Then we found Stephan who was highly recommended to us by our financial advisor. My husband was skeptical at first but after talking to Stephan, who like my husband is clear and direct, getting his questions answered and then seen the numbers quoted, he knew we could trust Stephan. Thank you Stephan for helping us get our forever home.
